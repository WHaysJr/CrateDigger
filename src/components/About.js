          Crate Digger is a Los Angeles based group that plays noisy, heavy,
          post-hardcore. The group started with Chris Muench writing songs with
          a computer and a drum machine called Crate Digger after a while songs
          got past to Justin Hische (Drums) and Jesse Rowe. Jesse offered to
          play bass if the songs would end up playing live. After a year of
          writing, the guys got into a rehearsal space to iron the songs out.
          After a month, life got busy for Jesse, and he moved on from the band.
          In came Wayne, a life long friend of Chris. The group completed the
          writing of 9 songs and started playing live opening for Big Business
          and Multicult. The guys got a chance to get into a studio to record
          drums and a single for the nine songs with bass, guitar, and vocals
          recorded in the band's homes or rehearsal studio of four songs to
          become the Episode 1 EP. More shows got played, and then the group
          went to finish the other five songs recorded with the release of
          Episode 2 coming out in late 2020.
